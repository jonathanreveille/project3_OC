## Projet - Aidez Macgyver a s'Ã©chapper ! 

You can check out the project here [link to Github] (https://github.com/jonathanreveille/maze2.2.1.)

### Goal of this project
For this project, we had to create a 2D maze where our hero tries to escape from it.
So far, we just established the first level. We made sure that all of the game features
are well functionning.

This project runs with the **terminal** (version) and as well with the **pygame** library
for the graphic version.
You have the option in which mode you want to play this game.

#### Description of the project (game) :
The hero (Macgyver) in the game that is represented as MacGyver, he is controlled by the gamer,
and he needs to find items among the map, and finally gather them in order to build a seringe.
This seringe will help Macgyver and the gamer to put asleep the guard which is located 
at the end of the maze. If the guard is asleep, you win, if the guard is not asleep, you will
loose. If you want to suceed : **find the items before reaching the exit**.
