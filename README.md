## Python App Development - Projet 3 - Aidez MacGyver à s'échapper ! (*Help MacGyver to escape*)

Here is the link to the project [by clicking here!](https://github.com/jonathanreveille/maze2.2.1.)

### The project
For this project, we had to create a 2D maze in where our hero tries to escape.
So far, we have just established the first level of the game. It works under 
the **terminal mode** or you can play it in **graphics mode** (pygame library).
You have the free **option** to **select** in which **mode** you wish to **play**.

### Description of the project (game) :
The **hero** (Macgyver) in the game that is represented as MacGyver, he is controlled by the gamer,
and he needs to find **items** among the **maze**. Those items will allow him to build automatically
a seringe. This item becomes a weapon to fight against the **guard** that is standing at the **exit**.
If you manage to make the guard fall asleep you will win, without the seringe, you will
loose. If you want to suceed, I strongly recommande to **find the items before reaching the exit**. 

### What is in this project ?
- Use of OOP
- Use of pipenv (virtual environment with Python 3)
- Respect and follow recommandations from PEP8

### Prerequisites:
- pygame v.1.9.6
- python v.3.7.4

### Getting started:
0. Clone this project if you wish to play.

1. First of all, first you need to **install pipenv** ,
  and then launch
*`pipenv run install`
*`pipenv shell`
You are now ready to play, just one more step.
This will install all *requirementes* needed for this project.
The advantage of pipenv is that it is cross-platform. It is 
recommended by the official documentation.

### Launch the game
#### In terminal mode :
2. a) Set yourself at the root of the project (maze.2.2.1/)
*  Write in your command line : 
`python -m app`

#### With Pygame :
2. b)  Set yourself at the same position as in terminal, it will be launched with the file __main__ in /macgyver/views/
* Write in your commande line : 
`python -m macgyver`
